This is a React learning project from the Udemy React course with Max Schwarzmueller.

Hamburger Builder App (the popular American sandwich, not a citizen of Hamburg, DE, haha). Udemy code-along with Max Schwarzmueller.

While a link to the full solution is given at the end of the course, I followed every module and did the entire code-along. A working version of this project is deployed here where I used GitHub pages:

CSS modules are enabled so CSS classes can be scoped to a specific component and not applied globally. The project is "ejected."

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
