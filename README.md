Hamburger Builder App (the popular American sandwich, not a citizen of Hamburg, DE, haha). Udemy code-along with Max Schwarzmueller.

CSS modules are enabled so CSS classes can be scoped to a specific component and not applied globally. The project is "ejected."

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
