This is a React learning project from the Udemy React course with Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller.

Hamburger Builder App (the popular American sandwich, not a citizen of Hamburg, DE, haha).

While a link to the full solution is given at the end of the course, I followed every module and did the entire code-along. A working version of this project is deployed here where I used GitHub pages:

The back-end database of this project is located here:

At first glance the resulting app looks like mere child's play and to a Mid or Senior Dev, I'm sure it is. But, the code base here reflects days and days of focused study and pages and pages of code. This tutorial covered all the bases of building a professional, production-scale application in React. Finishing this entire course from tip to toe represents a significant amount of time, focus, and dedication. 

I plan to write in my own words/blog about everything I've leared here in order to solidfy my own understanding and knowledge. For now, here are some of the main concepts and libraries covered and employed in the coding of this app:

* Best practices for application architecture, e.g. components vs. containers, higher-order components, and utility files.
* React Router
* Axios
* Redux
* Redux Dev Tools
* Thunk
* Jest
* Firebase

CSS modules are enabled so CSS classes can be scoped to a specific component and not applied globally. The project is "ejected."

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
